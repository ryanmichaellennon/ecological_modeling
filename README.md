# ecological_modeling

These scripts were developed for demonstrating how Python can be used for ecological modeling.  As an example, datasets were used from the United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program.  These datasets can be downloaded in CSV format from https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/CSV/datamart_csv.html
